4: User Input (window.prompt, HTML textbox with .onclick and .value)
5: Type Conversion (Number(), String(), Boolean(), typeof)
6: Constants (const keyword)
7: Math Object (Math.PI, Math.E, Math.round, Math.floor, Math.ceil, Math.trunc, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, Math.log, Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.tan, Math.abs, Math.sign, Math.max, Math.min, Math.random)

2nd file has following topics:

8: If Statements (if, else if, else, comparison operators)
9: Checked Property (checkboxes, radio buttons, .checked)
10: Ternary Operator (condition ? true : false)
11: Switch Statements (switch, case, break, default, switch(true))
12: String Methods (.length, .charAt, .indexOf, .lastIndexOf, .trim, .toUpperCase, .toLowerCase, .repeat, .startsWith, .endsWith, .includes, .replaceAll, .padStart, .padEnd)
13: String Slicing (.slice method, extracting substrings)
14: Method Chaining (calling multiple methods in one line)

3rd file has following topics:

15: Logical Operators (&&, ||, !, combining boolean conditions)
16: Equality Operators (=, ==, ===, !=, !==)
17: While Loops (while, do-while, login system example)
18: For Loops (increment, decrement, limited repetition)
19: Functions (declaration, parameters, arguments, return, reusable code)

4th file has following topics:

20: Arrays (push, pop, unshift, shift, length, indexOf, sort, reverse, for...of loops)
21: 2D Arrays (multi-dimensional arrays, matrix structure, accessing rows/columns)
22: Spread Operator (...) (expanding arrays/strings into separate elements, combining arrays)
23: Rest Parameters (...) (bundling arguments into array, variable number of parameters)
24: Callback Functions (passing functions as arguments, asynchronous operations)

5th file has following topics:

25: forEach() Method (iterate over arrays, apply callback to each element, modifies original)
26: map() Method (transform each element, returns NEW array, original unchanged)
27: filter() Method (filter elements by condition, returns NEW array with passing elements)
28: reduce() Method (reduce array to single value: sum, max, min, etc.)
29: Function Expressions (defining functions as values/variables, anonymous functions)
30: Arrow Functions (concise syntax, implicit return, perfect for callbacks)

6th file has following topics:

31: Objects (properties, methods, nested objects, 'this' in objects)
32: Constructors (constructor functions, 'new' keyword, 'this' in constructors, creating instances)
33: Classes (constructors, methods, inheritance, static methods)
34: Destructuring (array & object destructuring, renaming, default values, function parameters)

7th file has following topics:

35: ES6 Modules (import/export, named exports, default exports)
36: JSON (JSON.parse, JSON.stringify, working with API data)
37: Error Handling (try/catch/finally, throw, Error object, custom errors)

8th file has following topics:

38: Synchronous vs Asynchronous (setTimeout explained, blocking vs non-blocking, execution flow)
39: Callback Hell (nested callbacks, pyramid of doom, why to avoid it)
40: Promises (PENDING/RESOLVED/REJECTED states, chaining rules, .then()/.catch())
41: Async/Await (async keyword, await keyword, try/catch, sequential operations)
42: Fetch API (HTTP requests, response.json() explained, .then() vs async/await versions)
